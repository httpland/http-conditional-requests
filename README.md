# http-preconditions

HTTP Conditional Request middleware for standard `Request` and `Response`.

## What

Middleware for HTTP Conditional Requests.

It conditionally processes a HTTP request based on a precondition.

It compliant with
[RFC 9110, 13. Conditional Requests](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-13).

## Middleware

For a definition of Universal HTTP middleware, see the
[http-middleware](https://github.com/httpland/http-middleware) project.

## Usage

Middleware factory is exported by default.

To evaluate precondition, you need to provide a function to retrieve the target
resource.

```ts
import preconditions from "https://deno.land/x/http_content_minify@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";
import { assertSpyCalls, spy } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/mock.ts";

const request = new Request("<uri>", { headers: { "if-none-match": "<etag" } });
const targetResource = new Response("<body>", { headers: { etag: "<etag>" } });
const middleware = preconditions((request) => targetResource);
const handler = spy(() => targetResource);

const response = await middleware(request, handler);

assertSpyCalls(handler, 0);
assertEquals(response.status, 304);
```

## Preconditions

[RFC 9110, 13.1. Preconditions](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-13.1)
compliant and supports the following precondition

- [If-None-Match](#if-none-match)

### If-None-Match

If an `if-none-match` header is present in the request, a weak comparison is
made with the ETag header of the target resource.

If `if-none-match` evaluates to `false`, the handler is not executed and returns
a `304` status code response.

## Effects

Middleware will effect following:

- HTTP response status
  - [304 (Not Modified)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.5)
  - [412 (Precondition Failed)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.13)

## Conditions

Middleware will execute only if the following conditions are met:

- The Preconditions header exists
  - `If-None-Match`
    - The `ETag` header **does not exist**
